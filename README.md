# smart-beer-fridge
These are the python files you need for testing and running your smart beer fridge.  Keep in mind the main program called beerfridge_make.py has been modified from the original Make magazine tutorial to support an added relay feature.  More information on how to use these files is at John's DIY Playground on YouTube.  http://www.youtube.com/c/johnsdiyplayground
